Much of the installation of IBM's quantum computing open source software development kit called Qiskit can be found here https://qiskit.org/documentation/install.html

Preferably in a python virtual env (like by running for example `conda activate qiskit`)

* pip install qiskit
* download jupyter  https://jupyter.org/install
* register with ibm  https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/login
* navigate to your account and copy the token
* paste the token into a text file. In the code of quantum_random.ipynb replace this path "/Users/marklaney/Desktop/ibm_quantum_api_token.txt" with the path to your text file
* jupyter notebook
